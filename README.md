Hack MU 2012 - Android Game
==============

Event: http://hackmu.eventbrite.com/

This repository is left up for posterity. It is one of the first few Android project that a couple of the members of the team worked on, and was completed in under the 24 hour time limit required for the HackMU Hackathon, winning 2nd place.

This application is a prototype, and the 24 hour time-limit affected the quality, maintainability and readability of the application.
